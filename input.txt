React is a library for creating/building single page cloud native,Scalable web application.
React is component based archeitecture. React is Codeless but has more functionalites.

JSX(Javascript XML) is a templating engine used to build html by using javascript.Helps react to create light-weight virtual DOM.
XML is used to transfer data from one omputer to other computer.

Instead of using class="" in js, we use className="" in jsx.

Components are reusable react functionality that will get input as props and outputs jsx or null.
There are two types of Components
 1. Class-based Component
 2. Function-based Component

 In js function returns a value, in react function returns either jsx or null

Hooks:
 ->useState - useState hook allows you to add/manage state to function components, it returns an array with two values
   the current state and a function to update it. This is a stateful component.
   syntax: 
   const [count,setCount] = useState(0)
   return(
    <h2>I have {count} elements
    <button onclick={() => setCount(count + 1)}> 
   )

 ->useEffect - useEffect hook is used to perform side effects in function components, side effects are operations
   that change state of the component outside the component, such as fetching data, manually changing DOM.
    useEffect hook accepts two arguments a function and array of dependencies.Function is the code that will be 
    executed when component mounts/updates. 
     array of dependencies is a list of values the will cause the function to re-execute when change.

     useEffect(() => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        setCount((count) => count + 1)
      })
     })

Passing data through props, for passing data from parent to child component we use props. Props data
 is sent by parent component and cannot be changed by child component as they are read only.
